1.HTML (Structure): Create a list container using <ul> for tasks and <li> for each task item, with checkboxes and delete buttons.

2.CSS (Style): Apply styles to make the list visually appealing. Use CSS to format text, buttons, and add spacing.

3.JavaScript (Functionality): Use JavaScript to add interactivity. Attach event listeners to checkboxes to mark tasks as completed, and to delete buttons to remove tasks. Store tasks in an array or local storage for persistence.

4.Responsive Design: Ensure the list is responsive using media queries in CSS for various screen sizes.
